    These icons are used when people add your site to their home
    screens, and as a placeholder where a square image is needed.

    The Apple icon needs to be 144px by 144px. This will be scaled
    down for non-retina iPads to 72px by 72px (and for iPhones to
    114px and 57px respectively). Images that are uploaded which are
    larger than 144px by 144px will be scaled down as necessary.

    This image is also used where more specific logos are not
    available (e.g. people&rsquo;s profile pictures where
    they&rsquo;ve not uploaded a photo, or sermon series where
    you&rsquo;ve not uploaded a corresponding cover image).

  dev server)

# Diary

* Allow multiple schedules for regular events, with different names (e.g.

  already ScheduledEvents is actually true).
* Make it possible to create a RegularEvent from a ScheduledEvent (for when
  you've created an event once, and then realise it'll happen regularly).

  layer - allow series to go to multiple podcasts)

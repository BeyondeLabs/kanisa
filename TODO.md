# Banners

* Allow customising link text
* Track click-throughs?
* Fix issue where image doesn't load for some time (might be limited to the
  dev server)
* Ordering/prioritisation?

# Diary

* Allow multiple schedules for regular events, with different names (e.g.
  Football/Football Training)
* Make it impossible for a ScheduledEvent not to have a title (so that the
  warning on the RegularEvent page about changes not being propagated to
  already ScheduledEvents is actually true).
* Make it possible to create a RegularEvent from a ScheduledEvent (for when
  you've created an event once, and then realise it'll happen regularly).
* On mouseover of the "schedule this week's events, fade out regular events
  that would not be auto-scheduled (i.e. those with auto-schedule turned
  off).

# Sermons

  layer - allow series to go to multiple podcasts)

# Pages

# Social Media

* Allow delayed posting to Twitter (and Facebook?)
* Incorporate Twitter feed/Facebook feed into site?
* Follow us on Twitter/Like us on Facebook buttons?

* Allow admin staff to quickly give permissions (not too granular - based on
  content types rather than individual create/edit/delete for each).
* Allow quick membership approval process

# Members' Area

* Service Planning
* Rotas

# Misc

* Documentation (developer friendly/end user friendly)
